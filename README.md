# TradeKernel
Bare-Metal Real-Time OS for Ultra-Low-Latency Trading

## Overview
TradeKernel is a deterministic operating system engineered for high-frequency trading (HFT), written in C++ and Assembly. It eliminates traditional OS jitter through a custom scheduler, kernel-bypass networking, and pre-allocated memory to achieve sub-microsecond latency.

## Key Features
* Tickless Scheduler: CPU isolation and priority-based task dispatch (<500ns context switches).
* Zero-Copy Networking: Direct NIC access via DPDK/SPDK (UDP multicast optimized).
* Deterministic Memory: Physical memory pools with mlock()-style guarantees.
* Hardware Profiling: Cycle-accurate metrics using RDTSCP and PMU counters.
  
## Build & Deploy
### Requirements
* Hardware: x86_64 with Intel/AMD CPUs (NUMA-aware) or ARMv8+.
* Toolchain: GCC/Clang with -O3 -march=native.
* Copy
* git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TradeKernel.git  
* cd TradeKernel  
* make && make run  # QEMU-KVM or bare-metal  

## Performance
* Metric	Target
* Interrupt Latency	< 100ns
* NIC-to-UserSpace	< 300ns
* Memory Access	40ns (L1 cache)
